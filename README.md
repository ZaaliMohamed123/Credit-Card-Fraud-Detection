# **Credit Card Fraud Detection Project**

This project aims to build a logistic regression model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The key steps involved are:

1. Data Collection and Analysis:
   * Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values.
2.Handling Missing Values:
   * Check and handle any missing values in the dataset.
   * Use under-sampling to create a balanced dataset, addressing the imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
3. Data Splitting:
   * Split the balanced dataset into features and target.
4. Model Training:
   * Split the balanced dataset into training and testing sets.
   * Train a logistic regression model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation:
   * Evaluate the model's performance on both the training and testing data.
6. Predictive System:
   * Implement a function to predict whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on the trained model.
